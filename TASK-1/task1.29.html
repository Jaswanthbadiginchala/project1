  <p>
    The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag is used to indicate text in an <i>italicized</i> style, often for terms, names, or technical phrases without implying emphasis. 
    In contrast, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag represents <em>emphasized</em> text, conveying importance or stress, which also typically renders as italics but carries semantic meaning for accessibility tools like screen readers.
