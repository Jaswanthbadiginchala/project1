    One of my favorite movies is <b>Inception</b>, a brilliant piece of cinema that blends the 
    <i>science fiction</i> and <i>thriller</i> genres seamlessly. Directed by the visionary 
    <u>Christopher Nolan</u>, the film explores the complex world of dreams and subconscious manipulation. 
    With a gripping storyline, stunning visuals, and a powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, 
    <b>Inception</b> keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.
